# Why Literate Programming Matters

Modern web technologies provide a plethora of tools for authoring and publishing 
technical documentation. Yet, writing documentation is among the least favourite 
activities for most developers. Not for the acclaimed computer scientist 
[Donald Knuth][knuth], however. He has made many contributions to computer-aided 
documentation, mostly motivated by personal discontent with available tools and 
techniques.

When Knuth was finishing the second volume of his famous book series 
[The Art of Computer Programming][TAOCP], he was appalled by the quality of 
the draft prints he received from the publisher. For the first volume, 
typesetting was still done manually by professional layout designers. By
early 1970s the task was delegated to computers, which at that point, were not
very good at it. Knuth went on to design [Metafont][] and [TeX][], which quickly 
surpassed other typesetting programs of the era, and became the _de facto_ 
standard for scientific publications.

While Knuth was writing Metafont and TeX, he found that keeping all the 
information in his head was getting harder as his programs grew more complex. 
Especially, after he had taken a break from progamming. So, he devised a method 
to make the job easier by writing programs in a piecewise manner and documenting 
each piece meticulously (using TeX, of course). He arranged these code snippets 
(he called them macros) as if they were presented in a book. This way he could 
refresh his memory by reading the "book" from the beginning, and return to the 
point where he left off. He coined the term [literate programming][lp] to 
describe this methodology, and published another [book][] about the subject.

This kind of approach might seem overly laborious for regular programs, but I 
bet all developers can at least relate to the problem. If you leave some code 
behind for a couple of weeks and then return to it, you likely spend long time 
figuring out what it was supposed to do. Even if you don't think documentation 
would help you with this issue, there are other reasons for writing it. 

If you have ever written any non-trivial code, you have probably had this 
experience: you stare at the screen trying to convert your fuzzy ideas to code, 
but cannot get it together. Usually the best approach is to step away from the
computer, and sketch your design to a paper or whiteboard. That design you can 
then translate to whatever programming language you are using.

If you cannot formulate your idea verbally or visually, it's unlikely you can 
write it as code either. Writing is thinking, but unfortunately we don't think 
like computers. For us, it's easier to first describe our solution in natural 
language. If you methodically follow that practice, you are doing literate 
programming. It's like test driven development; but instead of writing tests
first, you document your code before before writing it. Same idea, different
paradigm.

## Why No Love?

Obviously literate programming isn't as popular as test driven development. One 
could argue that it never got into mainstream programming at all. 
[Many different reasons][] have been put forth why this is the case. For most
people the biggest threshold is writing itself. Ask any book author or magazine
editor; writing clear and readable prose is difficult and tedious.

Another issue that repeatedly comes up, is that tooling sucks. Luckily, this
is a problem that we can fix. We already have lot of technologies that help 
authoring and publishing web pages. Why not take best of them and build new 
tools that help writing code and documentation together. The ultimate goal is a 
fully integrated workflow where you can seamlesly build your application 
together with the documention. We already have interactive notebooks like 
[Jupyter] which enable this, so technology is not the biggest obstacle, clearly.

As with testing, it's best to keep the approach practical and not aim for
overly ambitious goals. Maybe we should not aspire to write top-quality books 
or publications but rather use these tools to communicate different things to 
different audiences. If you write just for yourself (solo developer project, for 
example) you can keep the bar real low. Other target audiences might include 
users, developers, testers, UX designers, sysadmins, devops engineers, or other 
stakeholders. By thinking what information you want to convey and to whom, it's 
easier to keep the scope of your documentation more concise.

The best part is that literate programming and web technologies allow you to 
integrate documentation to your product in new ways. That is the biggest
opportunity of the paradigm and the reason why there is still space for 
innovation.

## Literate Web Development with LiTScript

Here are some examples, how you can use LiTScript in your projects. Some use 
cases resemble "traditional" literate programming workflow, the others use the 
LiTScript more like a web build toolkit.

 1. Most of the time you probably use LiTScript to document your TypeScript
    modules. When you add headers and sections to your code, you often notice
    that you could rearrange your classes, functions, or methods a bit more
    logically. You group related functionality under their own subsections and
    write short descriptions what they are doing. You not only get nice 
    documentation as a result, but also make your code clearer in the process.

 2. Web projects consist of multiple file types. You might also want to create
    documentation for your [CSS files][] or even [JSON configuration files][].

 3. When you are writing libraries, you usually need some way to test them.
    Typically, you write unit tests or some simple testbench but LiTScript
    provides an alternative option. You can use the web site generated by
    LiTScript [as your testbench][]. This is particularly handy when using the
    [serve mode][]. You can see the effect of your code changes immediately.

 4. LiTScript provides the easiest way to maintain specification or architecture
    documentation. The documentation lives in the same repository with
    your code making it easy to see when it needs updating. You'll publish the 
    latest version to every time you commit your code.

 5. As LiTScript compiles and bundles your code and assets it can be used as a 
    general build tool Ã  la [Vite][] or [Rollup][]. In fact, LiTScript can be 
    seen as a light JS framework (like [Astro][]) when you add templates and web 
    componenents in the mix. It's very unopinionated tool, so it can bend to 
    multitude of usage scenarios.
