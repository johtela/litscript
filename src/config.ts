/**
 * # Configuration
 * 
 * LiTScript shares configuration with the TypeScript compiler wherever possible.
 * Additionally, it needs some settings to control what files are included in 
 * the documentation, what format is outputted, and so on.
 * 
 * These settings are defined in a configuration file called `litsconfig.json`
 * which resides in the project root folder along with the usual `tsconfig.json` 
 * file. The same settings can also be specified as command line switches. These
 * switches have the same names as the corresponding properties in the JSON file.
 * 
 * An example command line could look like this (each settings is described in 
 * the [Options](#options) section):
 * ```powershell
 * lits --baseDir . --outDir temp  --updateToc
 * ```
 * If a setting is not defined in the configuration or on command line, the 
 * default value takes effect. These are defined in the [Defaults](#defaults) 
 * section. The precedence order for settings is thus:
 * 
 *  1. Command line
 *  2. `litsconfig.json` file
 *  3. Default value
