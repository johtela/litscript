/**
 * # Bundling JS and CSS Files
 * 
 * [![](../images/webpack.svg =200x200)][Webpack]
 * HTML files need auxiliary JavaScript and style files to function properly. 
 * The template package provides these files but does not deploy them. There 
 * might be dozens of CSS and JS files needed by various elements in a page.
 * To make the deployment simpler we use [Webpack][] to bundle the files.
 * 
 * Bundling takes a root file, typically a JS or TS file, finds all the 
 * dependencies of the root file no matter how deep they are, and packs them
 * to output file(s). There will be a bundled JS file for each root file.
 * If you have CSS or [Less][] files in your dependency graph, those will be 
 * combined to a single CSS file.
 * 
 * The goal is to have fewer JS and CSS files to deploy, thus making the 
 * page loading times faster. To learn more about Webpack operation refer to
 * the excellent documentation on its [home page][Webpack]. 
 * 
 * [Webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/
 * [Less]: http://lesscss.org/
