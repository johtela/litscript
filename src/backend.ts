 * # ðŸ”™ Backend Support
 * 
 * LiTScript supports now building server-side (backend) JS modules. These are 
 * [Express.js applications][] which the LiTScript development server loads, and 
 * reloads when its source changes. In a standalone deployment scenario, you
 * include the built module in a node.js application. An example backend module
 * can be found in `tests/test-backend.ts`.
 * 
 * [Express.js applications]: https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#app

 * ## Express Middleware
 * 
 * The backend API is implemented as an Express middleware. We load the
 * bundle dynamically and invalidate it whenever it's updated.
 * 
 * The full path to the bundled JS module is stored here. The bundler sets this
 * variable using the `setBackendBundle` function. The reference to the Express
 * `app` is initially not set.
