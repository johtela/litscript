 * # ðŸ”™ Backend Support
 * 
 * LiTScript supports now building server-side (backend) JS modules. These are 
 * request listener modules which the LiTScript development server loads, and 
 * reloads when its source changes. In a standalone deployment scenario, you
 * include the built module in a node.js application. An example backend module
 * can be found in `tests/test-backend.ts`.

 * ## Express Middleware
 * 
 * The backend API is implemented as a single functionn reference whose type is
 * `RequestListener` which is defined in the `http` module of node.js. We load
 * the bundle dynamically and invalidate it whenever it's updated.
 * 
 * The full path to the bundled JS module is stored here. The bundler sets this
 * variable using the `setBackendBundle` function. The reference to the `app` is 
 * initially not set.
